    You finally reach the bottom of the stairs. The cellar is a chaotic
mess of chests, weapons, fabrics, and other miscellaneous items.
    ""I bet this is where they keep the items they recover from bandits.""
Bolli says. ""If there are no survivors, there is no one to return the
items to. Anyway we need to find a box with a symbol on it that looks
like this:"" Bolli shows you a piece of paper with a symbol drawn on it: 
a circle with lines spiraling towards the center. 
    Bolli begins to search the room, but your attention is fixed on 
a single chest. You walk over to the chest and open it. Inside is a small,
black box with the symbol Bolli showed you scratched into the top. As you
reach down into the chest, the whispered get louder until they are almost 
deafening. Your hand grabs the box, and suddenly your chest fills with 
a comforting warmth, and the whispers cease.
    ""Bolli I found it!"" You lift the box out of the chest to show Bolli. 
    Just as you are about to celebrate, there is a loud crash and dust 
pours from the ceiling. The walls threaten to buckle under the weight 
they have been burdened with for far too long.
